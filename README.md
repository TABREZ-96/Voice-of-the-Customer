## Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews in order to gain insights into customer opinions and satisfaction.
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information from source materials. In the context of Amazon reviews, sentiment analysis can be used to determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a review and gain insights into customer opinions and satisfaction towards specific products.

The Amazon review dataset provides a large number of reviews for various products, making it a valuable source of data for sentiment analysis. By analyzing the sentiment of these reviews, companies can gain a better understanding of customer satisfaction and make data-driven decisions to improve their products and customer service.

Additionally, sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews can also be useful for customers who are considering purchasing a specific product. By analyzing the sentiment of reviews, customers can gain a better understanding of the overall satisfaction of other customers and make more informed purchasing decisions.

In this project, we will be performing sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. The goal is to gain insights into customer opinions and satisfaction towards specific products and provide valuable information for both companies and customers.
